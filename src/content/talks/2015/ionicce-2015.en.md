### Resume

The second edition of the Ionic Meetup Fortaleza was another meeting held by the local community in Fortaleza at the end of 2015. At the meeting we discussed very interesting topics, such as some very new topics at the time, such as Push Notifications and an overview of Ionic 2 that was pre-release in the period.

# The Talk

I submitted a mini-talk about the importance of prototyping projects before starting and commenting a little about the [Ionic Creator](https://creator.ionic.io/) with the title: "What comes before the getting starter?". The main concept was to present strategies of visual validations for better product/development planning, even before starting to write code. [The slides have more details and you can check here.](https://felipesousa.github.io/talks/IonicMeetup/#/)
