The first edition of the Node User Group/CE, organized by great friends from Fortaleza, was my first opportunity for technical presentation, encouraged by some friends and specially by the invitation of [@ythecombinator](https://ythecombinator.space), I submitted a mini-talk about Static Generators, where I focused especially on [Hexo](https://hexo.io), a Static Generator created with NodeJS. I remember a lot how happy it was to finish the first performance. [You can check the slides here.](https://felipesousa.github.io/talks/NUG-CE/#/)
