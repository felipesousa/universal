### Resume

The meeting was promoted by the [Google Developers Group (GDG) Fortaleza](https://www.facebook.com/events/1985627951703018/) to debate and create activities together with the front-end/back-end development community in Fortaleza.

<br />

### The Talk

the title of the talk was **Progressive Web Apps Done Right**, I approached a vision of the past about the experience of users on the web within the last few years, the growth numbers of internet consumption and the constant bad signal quality and experience within of web-apps. PWA's break several concepts in the sense of how web applications were designed, expanding the options and experiences we can provide to users, from quick responses even with low internet signals (mainly offline!) To properties for a better experience in making your web-app a "installable" web-app.
