### Resumo

The 2018 edition of Front In Fortaleza was my first opportunity as an event hoster, where I was responsible for presenting the event throughout the day of content by invitation from my great friend and organizer of Front in Fortaleza [@eliasdeoliveira](https://www.instagram.com/faeliaso/), with great local and regional names. Front in Fortaleza is always a community that welcomes me with open arms and that I have a special affection for. Throughout
the day, speakers from the region shared content on a variety of subjects, from open-source to scalable architectures of front end applications.
