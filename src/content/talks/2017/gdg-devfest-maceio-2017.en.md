### Resume

The GDG DevFest Maceió 2017 was a great event that besides being super interactive, organized, had a lot of networking! This event gave me the opportunity, through an invitation from my friends from GDG Maceió, to lead a stand to talk more about in practice, how to create a PWA with Polymer and Firebase, the event had a dynamic audience with great national names and even international events, a rewarding event for being part of and having a great experience.
