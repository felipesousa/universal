## Resume

CEJS is one of the best known regional events in the Brazilian Northeast. Participating in this event was a personal achievement given the level of importance that the event has within the community. The event had a previous vote by the community for some positions remaining for the event that year, After a mini-talk and some votes, I was approved and selected to speak on the event's day.

### The Talk

Focused on components and new libraries, the lecture talks about how the Polymer library works, providing an overview of the new features, syntax, etc. In addition to focusing a lot on the key concepts of the Web Components Specs.
