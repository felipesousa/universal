### Resume

My story with Front In Fortaleza started well before this event, in fact this had been the third edition of the event that I was following, but the first as a speaker. It was a fantastic and clear experience, very challenging, it was one of my first presentations to larger audiences, with higher technical levels, etc.

# The Talk

On the day I focused on Accessibility and Semantics with HTML5 with the lecture: [**Thinking about an accessible application with HTML5**](https://felipesousa.github.io/talks/fif2016/#/), which was even presented at Java-CE meetup on the same year. Within the list of contents, I went from basic concepts, tools used to facilitate navigation for users who have a disability, HTML elements and basic tips to pass on to the user, whatever it may be, regardless of condition, connection or particularity, having access the information you need.
