### Resume

The 2016 GDG DevFest Nordeste took place in Maceió - Alagoas, about 950km from where I lived (Fortaleza/Ceará), the event showed me in reality the real power that technology can have in people's lives. I had the opportunity to meet great references in the technical area and also make great friends like [@gustavocostaw](https://twitter.com/GustavoCostaW), [@jeffersonmourak](https://twitter.com/jeffersonmourak), [@elisionfilho](https://twitter.com/elisionfilho) and many others. It was also my first experience as a speaker in another state, I remember with great affection and joy this great event! More details of the event can be seen in the video:

# The Talk

On the day, I presented on [how to build applications quickly with Angular and Firebase](https://felipesousa.github.io/talks/devfestne2016/#/), on the day I also did a live-demo interacting with all the audience present with a chat created with the technologies above.
