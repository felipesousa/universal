### Resume

The Event was organized by the [Java-CE community](http://www.javace.org/javou-08-java-technology-day/) where they always dynamize the presentation content and invited me to a presentation already done before, which was a positive surprise in addition to a different challenge, given that the community was not so directly linked to front development end and much less with direct accessibility, however, the content had a very positive approval which was super gratifying.

# The Talk

On the day I focused on Accessibility and Semantics with HTML5 with the lecture: [**Thinking about an accessible application with HTML5**](https://felipesousa.github.io/talks/javou/#/), which was even presented at other meetings in Fortaleza. Within the list of contents, I went from basic concepts, tools used to facilitate navigation for users who have a disability, HTML elements and basic tips to pass on to the user, whatever it may be, regardless of condition, connection or particularity, having access the information you need.
