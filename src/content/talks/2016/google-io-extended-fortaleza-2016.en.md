The meeting was promoted by the [Google Developers Group (GDG) Fortaleza](https://queroworkar.com.br/google-io-extended-fortaleza-2016/) to debate and create activities together with the front-end/back-end development community in Fortaleza. The meeting was focused on the news of the annual Google I/O event and also a conversation wheel on technology, development, etc.
