### Resume

The event was one of the editions of GDG Santiago in partnership with @concretelatinoamerica and [@4geeksacademy](https://www.4geeksacademy.co/). The meeting took place in Santiago, Chile at one of WeWork's headquarters. It was my first presentation outside of Brazil and also in another language, I spoke in Spanish and with the challenge with a new community, it was a very positive experience and well evaluated by the ~30 members who were on the day. [More details about the meeting can be seen here](https://www.meetup.com/gdg-santiago-chile/events/264634504/).

## Slides

On the day of the event, I talked about "Shared Web-Component with StencilJS", where I explored a little of the concepts behind all the architecture and how to use the main features and methods of the [@Stenciljs](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil) library. Within the content, I used a component that I created as an example in [live-code](https://github.com/felipesousa/stencil-movie-card).
