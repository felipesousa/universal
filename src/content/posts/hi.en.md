Hi all, welcome to my new space! Here I'll share a couple of things (not only technical things), I decided that after
pass a couple of years without write/share anything about my knowledge and also about my personal experiences.

I've many blog posts already written, only waiting for a place to be shared and yes, I knew that exists things
like [Medium](https://medium.com) and [Dev.to](https://dev.to), both are amazing places to write something, but I like writing also in my own blog.
I'll share my technical blog posts in both platforms mentioned above, but only the technicals, the rest
will be shared only here.

Oh, about it, I'm writing in English for 2 reasons, the first one is 'cause I can reach more people,
the second one is 'cause I'll be able to improve my english, mistakes will be made, but I'll learn with that and
that is what matters to me.

Well, for now, that's what I've for you.

Thank's you for your time, see you at the next one.

👋🏻
